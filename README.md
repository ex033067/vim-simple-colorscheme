# Simple colorscheme for neovim #

Mostly black letters over white background. Great to focus. Only a few
comfortable colors. Looks good in low light rooms.

Characteristics:
- White background.
- Most texts in black.
- Comments are gray and italicized.
- Strings and code blocks in comfortable blue.
- UI blue and gray.

Even better if your terminal supports _italic_ and **bold**.

Treesitter-aware for some highlight groups.
